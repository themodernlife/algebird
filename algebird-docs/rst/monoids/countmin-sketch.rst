Count-min Sketch
================

From wikipedia

> The Count–min sketch (or CM sketch) is a probabilistic sub-linear space streaming algorithm
> which can be used to summarize a data stream in many different ways.
> The algorithm was invented in 2003 by Graham Cormode and S. Muthu Muthukrishnan.
>
> Count–min sketches are somewhat similar to Bloom filters; the main distinction is that Bloom filters represent sets, while CM sketches represent multisets and frequency tables.

That's great.
