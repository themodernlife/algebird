Decayed value
=============

The Decayed Value can be used as a sort of windowed moving average.  Instead of storing the last :math:`N` points
(which requires memory :math:`O(N)`) a decayed value only requires :math:`O(1)` memory.

You can read more about different kinds of averages at http://donlehmanjr.com/Science/03%20Decay%20Ave/032.htm.
